*Causal Inference with Generalized Propensity Score*


pycausalgps is a Python package that provides end-to-end causal inference solutions with continuous exposures. By generating a unique hash value for the data and actions on the data, pycausalgps guarantees that each process is carried out once and the results are stored once.
