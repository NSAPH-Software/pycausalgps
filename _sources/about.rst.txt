pycausalgps is a Python library designed for implementing matching on Generalized Propensity Scores (GPS) in scenarios involving continuous exposures. The approach enables estimating causal effects using observational data tailored explicitly for settings with continuous exposures. By introducing a novel framework for GPS caliper matching, we provide a method that simultaneously matches on both the estimated GPS and exposure levels, ensuring comprehensive adjustment for confounding bias. This library offers a reliable and efficient solution for researchers and data scientists seeking to analyze causal relationships in the presence of continuous treatment variables under potential outcome framework.
